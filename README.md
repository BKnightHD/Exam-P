# Actuarial Exam Resources 📊  

This repository is a collection of resources, notes, and problem sets to help prepare for **SOA Exam P (Probability)** and future actuarial exams. The goal is to provide a structured, open-source resource hub for anyone pursuing actuarial credentials.

## 📌 Exam P Overview  
- **Exam Format:** 3-hour, 30 multiple-choice questions (computer-based)  
- **Purpose:** Develop knowledge of fundamental probability tools for quantitatively assessing risk  
- **Prerequisites:** Calculus (series, differentiation, integration) and familiarity with risk/insurance concepts  
- **Exam Window:** November 2025 and ongoing  
- **Syllabus Weighting:**  
  - General Probability: **23–30%**  
  - Univariate Random Variables: **44–50%**  
  - Multivariate Random Variables: **23–30%**

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo  
1. Start with **General Probability** (set theory, axioms, conditional probability).  
2. Move to **Univariate Distributions** and practice problems heavily.  
3. Advance into **Multivariate Distributions & CLT**.  
4. Regularly practice with SOA sample questions & time yourself.  
5. Use the provided notes for quick review before exam day.

## ✅ Goals of This Repo  
- Provide **free, structured study materials** for actuarial candidates  
- Organize resources by **syllabus topic**  
- Incorporate **active recall & practice-based learning**  
- Build a reusable framework for future actuarial exams (FM, IFM, etc.)

## 📅 Study Strategy Example  
- **Weekdays:** 1–1.5 hrs focused problem-solving  
- **Saturdays:** 3–4 hrs review + practice exams  
- **Sundays:** Rest or light review  
- **Target:** ~300 study hours before sitting for Exam P
